    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-5 text-blue-700">1. Introduction to Governor Limits</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Salesforce operates on a multi-tenant architecture, meaning that a single instance of the software serves multiple customers (tenants). To ensure that no single customer monopolizes the shared resources (like CPU, memory, database, network), Salesforce enforces strict runtime limits on Apex code and other platform features. These are known as <strong>Governor Limits</strong>.</p>
    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8 text-blue-600">Why do Governor Limits Exist?</h3>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mb-4 text-gray-700">
        <li><strong>Resource Sharing:</strong> Prevents any single organization from consuming all available resources, ensuring fair usage for all tenants on the shared infrastructure.</li>
        <li><strong>Scalability & Stability:</strong> Helps maintain the overall performance, stability, and reliability of the Salesforce platform for everyone.</li>
        <li><strong>Code Efficiency:</strong> Encourages developers to write efficient, bulkified, and optimized code. It forces good programming practices.</li>
        <li><strong>Security:</strong> Limits the potential impact of malicious or poorly written code.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Understanding these limits is not just about avoiding errors; it's about writing high-quality, performant, and scalable applications on the Salesforce platform. Failing to adhere to governor limits will result in runtime exceptions that halt your code execution.</p>

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-5 text-blue-700">2. Types of Governor Limits</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Salesforce imposes various types of governor limits, each targeting different aspects of code execution and resource consumption. It's important to be aware of the most common ones:</p>
    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8 text-blue-600">a. Per-Transaction Apex Limits:</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">These limits apply to a single Apex transaction. A transaction starts when a trigger fires, an anonymous block executes, a web service call is made, etc., and ends when all associated DML, SOQL, and other operations are complete.</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mb-4 text-gray-700">
        <li><strong>SOQL Queries:</strong>

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-5 text-blue-700">3. Common Governor Limit Errors</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">When governor limits are exceeded, Salesforce throws runtime exceptions that stop your code execution. Understanding these errors will help you diagnose and fix problems quickly:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mb-4 text-gray-700">
      <li><strong>System.LimitException: Too many SOQL queries:</strong> Occurs when the code executes more than 100 SOQL queries in a synchronous transaction.</li>
      <li><strong>System.LimitException: Too many DML statements:</strong> Happens if more than 150 DML operations are performed in one transaction.</li>
      <li><strong>System.LimitException: Apex CPU time limit exceeded:</strong> Apex code has run longer than 10 seconds synchronously or 60 seconds asynchronously.</li>
      <li><strong>System.LimitException: Heap size too large:</strong> The Apex heap size exceeds 6 MB (synchronous) or 12 MB (asynchronous).</li>
      <li><strong>System.LimitException: Too many callouts:</strong> More than 100 callouts or 120 seconds of cumulative callout time in a transaction.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Recognizing these exceptions early helps avoid costly debugging and improves code performance and reliability.</p>

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-5 text-blue-700">4. Strategies & Best Practices</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Writing governor-limit-aware Apex requires following best practices to keep your code efficient, maintainable, and scalable:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mb-4 text-gray-700">
      <li><strong>Bulkify Your Code:</strong> Always design code to handle multiple records at once, avoiding SOQL and DML inside loops.</li>
      <li><strong>Use Collections Wisely:</strong> Use lists, maps, and sets to reduce queries and DML operations.</li>
      <li><strong>Avoid Recursive Triggers:</strong> Prevent infinite loops by using static flags or handler classes.</li>
      <li><strong>Optimize SOQL Queries:</strong> Select only required fields, filter records with indexed fields, and avoid unnecessary queries.</li>
      <li><strong>Use Asynchronous Processing:</strong> For complex or long-running tasks, leverage `@future`, Queueable, Batch Apex, or Scheduled Apex.</li>
      <li><strong>Limit Data Returned:</strong> Use selective queries and pagination to limit heap usage and improve CPU time.</li>
      <li><strong>Test with Large Data Volumes:</strong> Write tests that simulate bulk data to verify your code handles limits gracefully.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-5 text-blue-700">5. Testing for Governor Limits</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Effective testing is essential to ensure your Apex code respects governor limits under real-world conditions:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mb-4 text-gray-700">
      <li><strong>Use @TestSetup Methods:</strong> Create reusable test data to simulate bulk processing.</li>
      <li><strong>Write Bulk Tests:</strong> Test triggers and classes with collections of records, not just single instances.</li>
      <li><strong>Simulate Limit Exceptions:</strong> Use mocks or specialized code patterns to mimic limit exceptions and verify graceful handling.</li>
      <li><strong>Measure Performance:</strong> Use debug logs to track CPU time, heap size, and query counts during test execution.</li>
      <li><strong>Leverage Salesforce Tools:</strong> Use Developer Console, Apex Test Execution, and the Limits class to monitor resource usage.</li>
      <li><strong>Continuous Integration:</strong> Integrate tests into CI/CD pipelines to catch limit-related issues early in the development cycle.</li>
    </ul>
